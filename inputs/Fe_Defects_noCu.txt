!***************************************************************************************************
!This is the input file for iron.
!It includes:
!1) Number of allowed species and identity of each species (Cu, V, SIA_mobile, SIA_sessile)
!2) Allowed defects of each species and combinations (Cu_n, V_m, Cu_nV_m)
!3) Migration energies of each species and diffusion prefactors
!4) Binding energies of each species to single defects (eg. V_n->V+V_n-1). NOTE: defects with 
!	multiple species (Cu_mV_n), need binding energies of each species allowed to dissociate
!	(single Cu or single V). Include possibility of larger (V_2) dissociation events as well.
!5) List of allowed single-defect reactions for each species and functional form of reaction rate,
!	including:
!5a)	Dissociation
!5b)	Diffusion between elements
!5c)	Removal (eg. by sinks)
!5d)	Conversion of species type (eg. SIA_mobile->SIA_sessile)
!
!6)	List of allowed multiple-defect reactions for each pair of species and functional form of 
!	reaction rate (clustering reactions) - including final defect type 
!	(eg. SIA_mobile+SIA_mobile->SIA_sessile)
!7)	List of allowed 0-defect reactions (cascade implantation), including:
!7a)	Cascade energies and avg. number of Frenkel pairs in each cascade energy
!7b)	DPA rate at each cascade energy
!7c)	Flag showing whether DPA rate is uniform or a distribution; if it is a distribution then
!		need to include functional form of DPA distrubtion as well as parameters input into
!		functional form.
!
!NOTE: functional forms 1 and 2 are reserved for two cases: zero and constant
